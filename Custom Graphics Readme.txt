Using custom graphics (assets):

If your custom assets folder is missing files, that's fine. 
Panel Attack will just use the stock assets for the missing files.

Step by step instructions for using custom graphics (Windows example):

1. Go to any Windows explorer window (my computer, my documents, my pictures, etc).

2. Type "%appdata%" without quotes into the address bar and hit enter.

3. See the folders: %appdata%\Panel Attack\assets\example folder structure 
   and %appdata%\Panel Attack\panels\example folder structure
   for a reference of where your assets should go and what files should be named.

4. Make a folder in your game saves directory like this:
   %appdata%\Panel Attack\assets\[your_set_name_here]
   or %appdata%\Panel Attack\panels\[your_set_name_here]

5. Place assets in that folder with the proper file names
   and file paths of the assets you want to replace.

6. Restart Panel Attack. Go into the options menu. Select the graphics/panels set with 
   the name you provided in step 4 (having multiple custom graphics sets is supported).
   The panels sets will also show in the lobby as per usual.

Note: if you would like to display a different character name for a custom character,
include a name.txt file in that character's folder. (but don't change the folder name!)
